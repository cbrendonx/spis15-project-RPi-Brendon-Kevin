# spis15-project-RPi-Brendon-Kevin

## Ideas:

1. Have the RPi detect an object (moving person) and follow them until the person sends a sound signal to the RPi, making it switch directions and search for a new moving object. 
2. Have a website/webapp that displays a livestream from the RPi and  allows users to control the RPi robot. The webapp should collect inputs from users and push them as commands to the RPi or another machine that interfaces with the RPi.
3. Solve a line maze efficiently.
4. Have the RPi collect objects, such as cups, in a walled area and move them to a base.
5. Have the RPi locate, follow, and attack the other RPi robots.
